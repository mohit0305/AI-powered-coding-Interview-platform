## Brief description of the project

Welcome to our AI-powered coding interview platform! This platform is designed to revolutionize the way coding interviews are conducted by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) with Large Language Model (LLM) technology. Our system enables candidates to have interactive conversations with our AI, providing them with a realistic interview experience.

  1. **Conversational Coding Problems:** Candidates can engage in a conversation with our AI system to discuss coding problems. The AI acts as an interviewer.

2. **Problem Statement:** The platform gives problem statement for candidates to solve. Each problem is carefully crafted to assess the candidate's coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

3. **Approach Analysis:** Candidates are required to explain their approach to solving the given coding problems. Our AI evaluates their approach, providing valuable feedback.

4. **Code Evaluation:** Once the candidate has explained their approach, they are prompted to write the actual code. The code is then evaluated using a Language Model (LLM) model powered by OpenAI, which analyzes the correctness, efficiency, and overall quality of the code.

5. **Candidate Performance Score:** The platform generates comprehensive performance score for each candidate. These reports include a detailed analysis of their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## System Architecture

The AI-powered coding interview platform consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend:** The frontend interface provides a user-friendly environment for candidates to interact with the platform. It allows them to view and respond to coding problems, communicate with the AI system, and receive feedback.

2. **Backend:** The backend handles the logic of the platform, including generating problem statements, analyzing candidate approaches, and evaluating code using the LLM model. It integrates with the frontend to facilitate seamless communication between the candidate and the AI system.

3. **LLM Model:** The Language Model (LLM) model is a powerful tool for evaluating the quality of code. It analyzes the code written by the candidate, checking for syntax errors, code structure, and adherence to best practices. The LLM model plays a crucial role in providing accurate and reliable code evaluations.

## Getting Started

To run the AI-powered coding interview platform locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jayraikhere/mercor-hackathon.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the backend server: `node index.js` from this repo https://github.com/jayraikhere/mercor-hackathon-backend.git
4. Launch the frontend interface: `npm start`
5. Access the platform in your web browser: `http://localhost:3000`
